# How the moving parts work

Notes on the pieces that aren't obvious from the screens. Configuration for all of them is in
[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

## Daily reminders

Two push notifications are sent by a single Vercel cron job declared in `vercel.json`, which
calls `/api/cron/reminders` once a day at 06:00 UTC.

- **Weigh-in reminder**: sent to anyone with daily check-ins switched on who has not logged a
  bodyweight for the current day. It names the streak once it reaches three days, and says so
  when a streak broke yesterday.
- **Time-off nudge**: sent once the last confirmed session is two days behind, then at most
  weekly until training resumes. Logging a session moves that date forward, which is what
  cancels the pending nudge.

At most one push goes out per user per day; the time-off nudge takes priority and leaves the
weigh-in reminder for the following day.

The rules live in `src/lib/reminders.ts` and read only stored data, so they work with the app
closed. Timers held inside the service worker cannot: the browser evicts an idle worker within
minutes, so `src/lib/swNotify.ts` is only used for the two-hour unfinished-session nudge.

To see what today would send you without waiting for the cron, open
`/api/cron/reminders?preview=1` while signed in. Preview never sends and never writes.

The job asks "did you log today" in each user's own calendar day. The browser reports its IANA
timezone when it registers a push subscription; users who registered before that existed are
treated as UTC until their next visit.

## Routine planner

`/plan` (linked from the Routine page as "Plan with Dot") replaces the user's training days,
muscle groups and exercises with a plan written by an LLM. Two ways in, one import path
(`src/lib/routinePlan.ts`): the plan is parsed and validated, laid over the current routine so
kept groups, days and exercises keep their ids and history, previewed with a summary of what
changes, and only saved when applied. Groups the plan drops are retired, not deleted, and the
previous routine is kept on the device for a week so the switch can be undone.

- **Plan with Dot**: five tap-to-answer questions, then one call to `/api/plan`, which plans
  from the stored routine with any OpenAI-compatible chat API. Each user gets 5 plans a day
  (tweaks included); a reply that can't be read gets one free repair attempt. Only the routine
  and the answers are sent, never the user's name, email or sessions.
- **Use your own AI**: copies a prompt carrying the routine and the format rules (shared with
  Dot, in `src/lib/planPrompt.ts`) for the user's own chatbot, and reads the reply pasted back,
  prose, code fences and curly quotes included.

## Estimated one-rep max

e1RM uses Brzycki: `weight × 36 / (37 − reps)`. It's what the progress charts and the
prescribed loads are built on.

/**
 * The four buzzes the app makes for Dot's moments, on both phones.
 *
 * Android (Chrome or the installed app) has the Vibration API and plays the patterns
 * as written: on, off, on, in milliseconds. Safari has no Vibration API, but from
 * iOS 18 toggling an `<input type="checkbox" switch>` plays the system's light tap.
 * That tap has one strength, so on an iPhone a pattern becomes a count of ticks.
 * Anywhere else both routes do nothing, which is the intended fallback: a haptic is
 * never the only signal of anything.
 *
 * On iOS 26.5 and later a switch toggled from script no longer ticks (WebKit bug
 * 309082): only a real finger landing on the switch's label does. So a button that
 * should be felt on an iPhone wears a <HapticTap /> — an invisible label over the
 * button that the tap lands on — and that tap is the first tick. The extra ticks of
 * a heavy set or a best still go through script, which older iOS versions play.
 *
 * Call it from the tap that caused the moment, not from an effect: iOS only plays the
 * switch's tap inside a user gesture.
